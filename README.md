# Foreword
The website is a picture sharing website based on PHP, JavaScript, Html and CSS technologies.
Before lauching the software, you should import our database, import the imageweb_image.sql and imageweb_user into your MySql. The name of database if called "imageWeb". You should use the same name when creating the database.

Then, import our code into your IDE. The file is imageWeb.zip.

Change the code in DB_Connection to connect with the database. Still you will have to change some of the other attributes of the database, including the username, the password and the local address.

After all, congratulations. You can start with all things been done!
